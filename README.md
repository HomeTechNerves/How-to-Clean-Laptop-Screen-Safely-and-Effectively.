Knowing [How to Clean Laptop Screen](https://hometechnerves.com/how-to-clean-laptop-screen/) properly is essential for keeping your device clear, streak-free, and looking brand new. Dust, fingerprints, and smudges can build up quickly, but with the right technique, you can clean your screen without causing any damage. At Home Tech Nerves, we recommend following a simple and gentle cleaning routine.

Step 1: Turn Off and Unplug Your Laptop

Always power down your laptop before cleaning. This protects your device and helps you see smudges more clearly.

Step 2: Use a Microfiber Cloth

Never use tissue or paper towels. Instead, wipe the screen gently with a dry microfiber cloth in small circular motions. This removes loose dust without scratching the surface.

Step 3: Apply a Screen-Safe Cleaning Solution

If smudges remain, lightly dampen the cloth with a screen-safe spray or a mix of distilled water and white vinegar (50/50). Avoid spraying directly onto the screen.

Step 4: Wipe Carefully

Use slow, gentle strokes to lift fingerprints and grime. Be sure not to press too hard.

By following these easy steps from Home Tech Nerves, you can keep your laptop display clean, clear, and protected. Now you know exactly How to Clean Laptop Screen the right way!
